# Claude Development Log

## 2025-01-22 - Version 2.0.2

### Issue
User reported that when increasing the number of mappings to 11 or more, those mappings were being ignored.

### Root Cause
Found a typo in `main.js:459` in the `parseMappings()` method:
- Code was reading `this.config.mappingCount` (camelCase)
- Actual config field is `mapping_count` (snake_case)
- This caused the code to always fall back to the default value of 10 mappings

### Fix
Changed line 459 in `main.js`:
```javascript
// Before:
const mappingCount = this.config.mappingCount || 10

// After:
const mappingCount = this.config.mapping_count || 10
```

### Files Modified
- `main.js` - Fixed typo in parseMappings method (line 459)
- `package.json` - Updated version to 2.0.2 and package script
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added entry for version 2.0.2
- `claude.md` - Created this development log

### Testing Notes
After this fix, users should be able to set `mapping_count` to any value between 1-200 in the module configuration, and the correct number of mapping fields will be displayed and parsed.
