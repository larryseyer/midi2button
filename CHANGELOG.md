and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.2] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed

- **Mapping count configuration bug**: Fixed typo where `parseMappings()` was reading `this.config.mappingCount` instead of `this.config.mapping_count`, causing the module to always default to 10 mappings regardless of user configuration

## [2.0.1] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed

- **Critical startup crash on fresh installations**: Module now properly initializes with default configuration values when no config exists
- Added null-safe config handling in `init()`, `configUpdated()`, and `parseMappings()` methods
- Default values: `http_host: '127.0.0.1'`, `http_port: 8000`, `mappingCount: 10`, `midi_port_index: -1`, `press_delay: 500`
