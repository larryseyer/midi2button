Turn your MIDI keyboard into an OSC controller.

[Download](https://github.com/larryseyer/companion-module-generic-midi2osc/releases/download/v1.0.4/generic-midi2osc-1.0.4.tgz)

## What Does This Do?

This module lets your MIDI keyboard talk to other programs using OSC messages. When you press a key on your keyboard or send a bank and program change, it can send a message to control lighting, audio, video, or any other OSC-enabled software.

## Typical Use Cases

- **Live Performance**: Use a MIDI foot controller to trigger scenes, cues, or effects in QLab, Resolume, or other OSC-enabled software
- **Broadcast Control**: Map MIDI controllers to control video switchers, audio mixers, or lighting consoles via OSC
- **Studio Automation**: Convert MIDI keyboard/pad messages to OSC for controlling DAWs, plugins, or custom software
- **Program Changes**: Use MIDI Bank/Program Change messages from keyboards or controllers to switch between hundreds of different OSC commands (16,384 banks √ó 128 programs = over 2 million possible combinations!)

## Features

‚úÖ **Super Simple Setup** - Connect your keyboard in seconds
‚úÖ **Live Monitoring** - See what's happening in real-time
‚úÖ **Works with Any MIDI Device** - Keyboards, drum pads, controllers
‚úÖ **Flexible Rules** - Create up to 24 different mappings with custom names
‚úÖ **Visual Feedback** - Buttons light up to show activity
‚úÖ **Bank & Program Changes** - Support for MIDI Bank Select and Program Change messages
‚úÖ **Enhanced UI** - Color-coded rules, duplicate/delete/reorder capabilities
‚úÖ **Import/Export** - Share or backup your rule configurations

## Quick Start Guide (3 Easy Steps!)

### Step 1: Connect Your Keyboard üéπ

1. Plug in your MIDI keyboard to your computer
2. Open the module settings in Companion
3. Pick your keyboard from the dropdown list
4. Click SAVE at the bottom

### Step 2: Make Your Rules üìù

1. Stay in the module settings
2. Choose how many rules you want (start with 1 or 2, up to 24)
3. Click SAVE to see your rules appear
4. For each rule:
   - Give it a name (optional but helpful!)
   - Check "Enable this rule" ‚úÖ
   - Pick what key triggers it (like Middle C = 60)
   - Set where to send the message (usually keep the defaults)
5. Click SAVE again and you're done!

### Step 3: Test It! üéâ

1. Press keys on your MIDI keyboard
2. If a key matches one of your rules, it sends an OSC message
3. Check your receiving program to see the messages arrive

### Optional: Monitor with Stream Deck Buttons üéØ

If you have a Stream Deck and want to see what's happening:

1. Go to the Buttons tab in Companion
2. Find "generic-midi2osc" in the list
3. Drag these monitoring buttons to your Stream Deck:
   - **MIDI Connection** - Shows if your keyboard is connected (green = good!)
   - **Activity Light** - Flashes green when messages are sent
   - **MIDI Input** - Shows what key you're pressing
   - **OSC Output** - Shows what message was sent

## Installation

### Easy Way

1. Download the module file from the releases page
2. Open Companion
3. Go to the Developer tab
4. Click "Import Module" and pick the file
5. Done! Find it in your Connections list

## Understanding the Settings

### What's a Rule?

A rule tells the module: "When I press THIS key, send THAT message"

### Rule Settings Explained (In Simple Terms)

**üìù Rule Name** - Give your rule a descriptive name (e.g., "Trigger Next Cue", "Red Lights")

**‚úÖ Enable this rule** - Check this box to make the rule work

**üì¶ Collapse rule details** - Save screen space by hiding the rule configuration

**What kind of control?**

- üéπ Piano Key = A regular key on your keyboard
- üéõÔ∏è Knob/Slider = A knob or slider that you can turn/move
- üéµ Program Change = Used to switch sounds/patches with bank selection

**Which number?** - Every key has a number (Middle C = 60)

- Don't know the number? Press the key and watch the MIDI Input button!

**From which channel?** - Usually keep this on "üåç All Keys"

**Message name** - The name of your OSC message (like `/midi/note/60`)

**Message data** - What information to send:

- `$(value)` = How hard you pressed the key (velocity)
- `$(channel)` = The MIDI channel number
- `$(bank)` = The bank number (for Program Changes)
- `$(program)` = The program number (for Program Changes)
- Keep this as-is unless you know what you're doing

**To which computer?** - Where to send the message:

- `127.0.0.1` = This computer (most common)
- Or enter another computer's IP address

**On which port?** - The network port number (usually 8000 or 9000)

### Example: Setting Up Your First Rule

Let's make Middle C on your keyboard send an OSC message:

1. **Name your rule** - Type something like "My First Rule" (optional)
2. **Turn on Rule 1** - Check the "‚úÖ Enable this rule" box
3. **Set it to Piano Key** - Choose "üéπ Piano Key" from the dropdown
4. **Enter 60** - That's Middle C's number
5. **Keep the rest as default** - It's already set up correctly
6. **Click SAVE** at the bottom
7. **Press Middle C** - Watch the Activity Light turn green!

That's it! When you press Middle C, it sends `/midi/note/60` with the velocity value.

### Using Bank and Program Changes üéµ

Program Changes let you trigger different OSC commands by switching "patches" on your MIDI device. Combined with Bank Select, you can access thousands of different triggers from a single MIDI controller!

#### What Are Program Changes?

Originally designed to switch sounds on synthesizers, Program Changes are perfect for triggering different scenes, cues, or states in your software. Many MIDI foot controllers, keyboards, and pad controllers can send these messages.

#### How It Works

1. **Your MIDI device sends two things:**
   - **Bank Select** (optional): CC 0 and/or CC 32 to choose a bank (0-16383)
   - **Program Change**: Selects a program number (0-127) within that bank

2. **The module responds:**
   - Tracks the current bank for each MIDI channel
   - When a Program Change arrives, checks if you have a rule for that bank/program combo
   - Sends your configured OSC message if there's a match

#### Setting Up a Program Change Rule

1. In your rule configuration, select **"üéµ Program Change"** from the dropdown
2. Set the **üè¶ Bank Number** (0-16383) - which bank to listen for
3. Set the **üéµ Program Number** (0-127) - which program in that bank
4. Configure your **OSC message** to send when this combo is received
5. Save your configuration

#### Real-World Examples

- **Live Theater**: Bank 0 = Act 1, Bank 1 = Act 2. Program Changes trigger different lighting/sound cues
- **Live Music**: Each song gets its own bank. Program Changes switch between verse/chorus/bridge effects
- **Broadcast**: Bank per show segment. Programs trigger different camera angles or graphics
- **Installation**: Different banks for different modes (day/night/special events)

**Example Setup**:

- MIDI sends: Bank 2, Program 5
- Module sends: `/qlab/go/next` to trigger the next cue
- Or: `/resolume/layer/1/clip/17/connect` to trigger a specific video clip

### Advanced Features (New in 1.0.4!)

#### Rule Management

Each rule now has a **dropdown menu** with actions:

1. **üìã Duplicate this rule** - Create a copy of the rule
2. **üóëÔ∏è Delete this rule** - Remove the rule
3. **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Move this rule up** - Reorder rules
4. **‚¨áÔ∏è Move this rule down** - Reorder rules
5. **üì§ Export this rule to log** - Export just this rule

**How to use:** Select an action from the dropdown and click SAVE. The action executes and the dropdown resets.

#### Global Actions

At the top of the configuration, use the Global Actions dropdown for:

- **üì§ Export ALL rules to Companion Log** - Exports all rules as JSON
- **üóëÔ∏è Clear ALL rules** - Remove all rules and start fresh

#### Import/Export Rules

**IMPORTANT:** Exports appear in the **Companion Log Window** formatted as JSON with clear copy markers!

**To Export:**

1. Select "Export ALL rules" from Global Actions dropdown (or "Export this rule" from a rule's dropdown)
2. Click SAVE
3. Open Companion's Log window: **View ‚Üí Log** (or press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+L)
4. Look for the lines between `=====COPY FROM HERE=====` and `=====COPY TO HERE=====`
5. Select **EVERYTHING** from the first marker to the last marker (including the marker lines)
6. Copy (Cmd/Ctrl+C) - don't worry about timestamps, they're automatically cleaned during import!

**To Import:**

1. Copy your exported data from the log (including all timestamps and markers) or from a saved file
2. Paste it directly into the "Import Rules" field in the configuration
3. Click SAVE
4. Your rules will be imported and the mapping count will update automatically
5. The import field will clear upon successful import

**What's Included in Export:**

- All your mapping rules with their settings
- MIDI port configuration (automatically restored on import)
- Rule names and all parameters

**Smart Import Features:**

- Automatically strips timestamps from log output
- Finds and extracts JSON data regardless of format
- Handles both old format (array) and new format (with MIDI port)
- Updates mapping count to match imported rules
- Clears import field after successful import

Perfect for:

## Troubleshooting (When Things Don't Work)

### My keyboard isn't showing up!

- Make sure it's plugged in and turned on
- Try unplugging and plugging it back in
- Restart Companion
- Make sure no other program is using your keyboard

### The Activity Light doesn't turn green!

- Check that your rule is turned ON (checkbox checked)
- Make sure you're pressing the right key number
- Check that your MIDI Connection button is green

### My other program isn't getting OSC messages!

- Make sure the port number matches (try 9000 if 8000 doesn't work)
- Check that your other program is listening for OSC
- Press the "Send Test OSC" button - if that works, the problem is with your rules
- Make sure the IP address is correct (127.0.0.1 for same computer)

### Common Port Numbers

- **8000** - Default (but sometimes used by other programs)
- **9000** - Good alternative if 8000 is busy
- **7000** - Another option
- **53000** - QLab default
